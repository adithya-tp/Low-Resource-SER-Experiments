# Low-Resource-SER-Experiments
Project component for 11-785 (Introduction to Deep Learning) at CMU. Our experiments to build a better speech emotion recognition system for low resource languages. 


## Implementation of GE2E Loss:
The implementation is in the folder "GE2E". Pytorch implementation of Generalized End-to-End Loss for speaker verification, proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10467.pdf [3].
We referenced the code from https://github.com/cvqluu/GE2E-Loss
